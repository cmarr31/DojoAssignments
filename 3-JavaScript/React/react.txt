Helping you select an MV* framework
DownloadView on GitHubBlog
Introduction
Developers these days are spoiled with choice when it comes to selecting an MV* framework for structuring and organizing their JavaScript web apps.

Backbone, Ember, AngularJS… the list of new and stable solutions continues to grow, but just how do you decide on which to use in a sea of so many options?

To help solve this problem, we created TodoMVC 
- a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using MV* concepts in most of the popular JavaScript MV* frameworks of today

const MyComponent = (data) => UI;
// For those less ES6-inclined:
function MyComponent(data) { return UI; }

const HeadlineComponent = (data) => {
return React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello Dojo!');
}

The above example uses an arrow function, but we could have written it as:

const HeadlineComponent = function(data){
return React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello Dojo!');
}
