        /* Range Print
            Create a function that can take a start point, end point, and skip amount, to print all numbers in the range.
            For example:
            printRange(2, 10, 2);
            Copy
            Would print
            2
            4
            6
            8
            (Should go UP TO, but NOT INCLUDING the end point)
            Bonus (Only If You Have Time):
            Make sure it works for negative numbers
            If the user doesn't pass a skip amount, make it default to 1 (printRange(4, 8); would print 4, 5, 6, 7)
            If the user doesn't pass an end point, make it start at 0, and end at the first (printRange(4); would print 0, 1, 2, 3)
