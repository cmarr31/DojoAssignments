Assignment: Making and Reading from Dictionaries
Create a dictionary containing some information about yourself.
The keys should include name, age, country of birth, favorite language.

Write a function that will print something like the following as it executes:

My name is Anna
My age is 101
My country of birth is The United States
My favorite language is Python

There are two steps to this process, building a dictionary and then gathering all the data from it. 
Write a function that can take in and print out any dictionary keys and values.

Note: The majority of data we will manipulate as web developers will be hashed in a dictionary using key-value pairs. 
Repeat this assignment a few times to really get the hang of unpacking dictionaries, as it's a very common requirement of any web application
