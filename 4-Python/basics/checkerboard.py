Assignment: Checkerboard
Write a program that prints a 'checkerboard' pattern to the console.
Your program should require no input and produce console output that looks like so:
* * * *
 * * * *
* * * *
 * * * *
* * * *
 * * * *
* * * *
 * * * *
Each star or space represents a square.
On a traditional checkerboard you'll see alternating squares of red or black. 
In our case we will alternate stars and spaces. 
The goal is to repeat a process several times. 
This should make you think of looping.

def checkerboard():
	columns = 4
	rows = 4
	star = "* "
	space = " *"
	for i in range(0,rows):
		print star * columns
		print space * columns
	
# test
checkerboard()
