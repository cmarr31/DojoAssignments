If you encounter problems getting these fully installed, make sure you speak up to others in your cohort to get any problems debugged and addressed early. 
It is important to do this before you reach the point in the bootcamp when these are needed, at which point they will be assumed to already be installed. 

Learning Objectives

Understand what the web is and how we, as Web Developers, will be working in it.

Lecture Outline

What is the Web?
HTTP Request/Response Cycle, DNS
Who is a client? What is the server? - IKEA/Restaurant analogy
Lecture Overview

Give a brief 5 minute lecture about what the internet is. 
Talk about the relationship between a Client and a Server and walk the students through the HTTP Request and Response cycle. 
Michael Choi’s IKEA model is always a good analogy to use, but since they'll watch that video later in this chapter, I use a different analogy. 
I like to compare what happens on the server side to a restaurant (client walks in, greeted by a host, directed to a table, the client makes an order, 
the waiter takes the request to the kitchen, the kitchen assembles the order, serves it to the client).
