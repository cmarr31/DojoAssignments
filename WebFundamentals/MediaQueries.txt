Media Queries

Media queries allow developers to target specific device features and/or screen sizes and implement styles for those media types. 
Media query is the most powerful tool for creating responsive layouts. 
It is the tool that makes our page "respond" to whatever device the browser is being shown.

Syntax
When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules.

@media [media type] {
 /* styles here */
}

Example
Note: The styling rules applied inside a specific media query will only be executed if the media query rules are met.

width <= 480px - Rules applied if browser's width is 480px and below.

@media all and (max-width: 480px) {
 /* styles here */
}

width >= 960px - Rules applied if browser's width is 960px and above.

@media all and (min-width: 960px) {
 /* styles here */
}

width >= 1024px - Rules applied if browser's width is 1024px and above.

@media all and (min-width: 1024px) {
 /* styles here */
}

Notice that we use all as our media type in our examples above. 
This recognized media type is suitable for all devices. 
Media types specify how a document is to be presented on different media: 
on the screen, on a paper (print), with a speech synthesizer, with a braille device, etc.

The default media type is screen if we don't specify any. 
Using all as media type is really not a good idea because we don't normally want our webpage to look the same on different media. 
For example, the font-size property is useful both for the screen and print media. 
The two media types are different enough to require different values for the common property; 
a document will typically need a larger font on a computer screen than on a paper. 
Therefore, it is necessary to express that a style sheet, or a section of a stylesheet, applies to certain media types.

Recognized media types:

all - Suitable for all devices
braille - Intended for braille tactile feedback devices
embossed - Intended for paged braille printers.
handheld - Intended for handheld devices (typically small screen, limited bandwidth)
print - Intended for paged material and for documents viewed on screen in print view mode.
projection - Intended for projected presentations (projectors)
screen - Intended primarily for color computer screens
speech - Intended for speech synthesizers
tty - Intended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid(such as teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display capabilities)
